This project aim to R/W an ansible-vault yaml file.

**This is not Ansible official project.**

You can install with pip.

from ansible_vault import Vault

vault = Vault('password')
data = vault.load(open('vault.yml').read())
```

When you have to write data, then you can write data to file. See below.

```python
from ansible_vault import Vault

vault = Vault('password')

# also you can get encrypted text
