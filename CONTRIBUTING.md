# Contributing to this repository

## What I need to be contributed

* Expand Sample cases of using VaultLib, work around files.
  * Add sample to doc/sample.md and make a pr.
* Expand support for CPython released version.
  * Please update test/GitHub Actions and setup.py.
* Security improvement.

## What I'm not intend to do

* Expand support file types.
  * I'd like to suggest to use Vault#load\_raw/dump\_raw method, like [sample](https://github.com/tomoh1r/ansible-vault/wiki/sample#around-file-types).
